To-do:
Yet to consider the case where no charging station can be reached on current charge.

Currently:
Considers charging stations in the quadrant in which the destination lies considering the source is kept at the origin and 
refines the choice of charging stations based on that. Then further decisions regarding the routing are made based on the 
car-model and remaining charge in the battery. User made to reconsider the decision of visiting the charging station if the 
vehicle can get to the destination without visiting one and the detour due to visiting the charging station is above a certain
threshold. In other cases the algorithm decides.
